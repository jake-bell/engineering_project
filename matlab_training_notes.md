# Cross validation:
# Generally, anything above 0.7 is pretty crap
## All quick to train:
1.1 Linear regression:
- Useless
- Training RMSE: 3.518
1.2 Fine tree:
- Best, pretty accurate
- Training RMSE: 0.37108
1.3 Medium tree:
- Second best, kinda accurate
- Training RMSE: 0.55611
1.4 Coarse tree:
- Not too bad, somewhat accurate, clumps a bit much.
- Training RMSE: 1.089

## All neural networks
2.1  Narrow Neural netork:
- spastic
- Training RMSE: 2.8962
2.1  Medium Neural netork:
- closer, but still weird
- Training RMSE:  1.4944
2.1  Wide Neural netork:
- Good, very accurate
- Training RMSE:  0.4759
2.1  Bilayered Neural netork:
- Pretty good
- Training RMSE: 0.67125
2.1  Trilayered Neural netork:
